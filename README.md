# My Power BI Dashboards

## Introduction

As I explore and learn more about Power BI, I use this repository to showcase my personal dashboard projects. The dashboards are created to demonstrate various features and capabilities of Power BI, and I'll continue updating this repository with new dashboards as I create them.

## Live Dashboards

You can access the live dashboards under each markdown file of the repo which are hosted on NovyPro website. Check back regularly as I plan to add more dashboards to this collection.

## Usage

You can explore the dashboards, analyze the data, and interact with the visualizations. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to let me know.
